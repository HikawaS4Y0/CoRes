# TaskRes
The official implementation of *Task Residual for Tuning Vision-Language Models*. The code will be released soon.

## Brief Introduction

Illustration of (a) Zero-shot CLIP, (b) prompt tuning, (c) adapter-style tuning and (d) our proposed Task Residual Tuning (TaskRes). Our method introduces a *prior-independent* task residual to the fixed pre-trained classifier (*i.e.*, text embeddings of CLIP), being free of running the text encoder every time or extra architecture design.
